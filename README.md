Group project in CPSC 4820 where we created a hurricane simulator game for children that live on the coast. This game is a "Choose Your Adventure" type game where the goal is to have questions displayed to the user where one question is an appropriate action to take during a hurricane and another is not so much.

This game we created uses an Arduino to accept button inputs from the user that will progress the game. The game is displayed to the user using PyGame with images and text that corresponds to the questions.
